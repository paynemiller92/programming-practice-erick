/**
 * Create a program that prompts for an input string and dis- plays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.
 *
 * Example Output
 * What is the input string? Homer Homer has 5 characters.
 *
 * Constraints
 * • Be sure the output contains the original string.
 * • Use a single output statement to construct the output.
 * • Use a built-in function of the programming language to
 *   determine the length of the string.
 *
 * Challenges
 * • If the user enters nothing,state that the user must enter something into the program.
 * • Implement this program using a graphical user interface and update the character counter
 *   every time a key is pressed. If your language doesn’t have a particularly friendly GUI
 *   library, try doing this exercise with HTML and JavaScript instead.
