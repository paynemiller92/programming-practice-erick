/**
 * Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the
 * quotation marks themselves by using escape characters. Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.
 * Display the quotation and author as shown in the example output.
 *
 * Example Output
 * What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for. Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
 * Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids
 * you're looking for."
 *
 * Constraints
 * • Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
 * • If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, don’t use it for this exercise.
 *   Use string concatenation instead.
 *
 * Challenge
 * • I  Chapter7,Data Structures,on page 63,you’ll practice working with lists of data. Modify this program so that
 *   instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you cre- ate a structure that holds quotes and their associated
 *   attributions and then display all of the quotes using the format in the example.
 *   An array of maps would be a good choice.
