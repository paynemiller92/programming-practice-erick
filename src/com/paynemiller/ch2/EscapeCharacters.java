    Display the quotation and author as shown in the example output.

    In Chapter7,DataStructures,on page 63, youâ€™ll practice working with lists of data.
    Modify this program so that instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create
    a structure that holds quotes and their associated attributions and then display all
    of the quotes using the format in the example. An array of maps would be a good choice.
